# Resume-Screener 
The primary objective of this project is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) technology to 
enhance the efficiency of the human resource department in the crucial task of screening resumes 
before the interview stage
The proposed system encompasses two primary functions: resume parsing and matching resumes to job 
descriptions. These functions are designed to streamline and enhance the recruitment process.
In the development of the Resume Parser project, various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and 
techniques were employed to enhance the efficiency of text processing.
We have publicly available data from Kaggle.
We used 2 resume datasets. Both Training Dataset and Test Dataset are from Kaggle. Data is in CSV
format.
Training Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset
Test Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset
The methodology employed in this project centers around Named Entity Recognition (NER), a crucial 
component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that facilitates the analysis of extensive volumes of 
unstructured human language. 
In the pursuit of automating the screening process, the developed system has successfully analyzed a 
collection of resumes against a set of required skills. The process involved the extraction of text from 
each resume, cleaning the text, and calculating a skill match score to evaluate the alignment of the 
candidate's skills with the specified requirements.
